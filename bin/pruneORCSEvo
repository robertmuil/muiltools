#!/bin/bash
#
# Intended for pruning of the ORCS gen directories created by evolution.
#
# Given a certain saveCount (modifieable below), this script will delete all but saveCount of the gen
# directories. The directories left will be evenly distributed from the 1st to the last of the gen directories.
# The remaining directories will probably not be exactly the saveCount, because the last directory in the order is ALWAYS kept, and because the arithmetic is coarse integer-based. The number kept should always exceed the saveCount.
#
# Parameters:
#  saveCount	int: number of directories to preserve (rest will be pruned)
#  safeOp			boolean: operate safely - the directories to be pruned are saved in a directory. if this is false, pruned directories are simply deleted.
#  pruneDir		string: directory into which the pruned directories are saved, if safeOp is true.
