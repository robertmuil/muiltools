muiltools
=========

A selection of primarily command-line tools often used (atm on linux systems), which I previously maintained with unison (and then Wuala) syncing across systems.

Under the bin[x] directories are binary files:
bin files are for all architectures and so are usually scripts (shell or python)
bin-x86 files will only be installed for 32-bit systems
bin-x64 files will only be installed for 64-bit systems
